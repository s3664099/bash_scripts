# Bash Scripts

This is a collection of bash scripts that I have written.

## push_git.sh

This script is designed to automate pushing scripts to a github repository. The repository needs to have already been created and the origin set up.

### Executing the code

* git_push '<include message here>'

### Setting up the code
